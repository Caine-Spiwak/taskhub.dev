# taskhub.dev
A life management app inspired by Tony Robbins RPM framework. Organize your goals by project, each project having organizable tasks, and each task having organizable todos.

# Why was TaskHub created?
+ Sometimes the standard todo list isn't enough.
+ Which task should you be working on with your limited time?
+ How can you tell at a glance, which todo brings you closer to accomplishing which goal?
+ Many times your todos will have their own set of "sub-todos" that you must complete.

With TaskHub you can manage many projects. Those projects will have their own tasks that can be sorted in the order in which they must be completed or in order of importance. But it doesn't stop there. Each Task will have it's own set of todos which can be organzied in the same way.
